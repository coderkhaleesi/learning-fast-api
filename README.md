# learning-fast-api

In this repository, I am documenting my journey in building, testing and deploying a backend API with FastAPI. The book "Building Data Science Applications with FastAPI" is taken as a reference. I am also going to experiment with RayServe to serve the API at scale.

The format of this is going to be in small posts - each post with a new concept I learned along the way documented in the folder "learnings". I kept this format so that I can export it to LinkedIn or Medium, or even Instagram at a later stage.

All the code created will also be available in this repository.
